    *Grilled Cheese 101*: Use delicious cheese and good quality bread; make crunchy on the outside and ooey gooey on the inside; add one or two ingredients for a flavor punch! In this case, cherry preserves serve as a sweet contrast to cheddar cheese, and basil adds a light, refreshing note. Use __mayonnaise__ on the outside of the bread to achieve the ultimate, crispy, golden-brown __grilled cheese__. Cook, relax, and enjoy!
